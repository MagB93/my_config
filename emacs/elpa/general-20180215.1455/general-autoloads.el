(autoload 'general-define-key "general" "\
The primary key definition function provided by general.el.

Define MAPS, optionally using DEFINER, in the keymap(s) corresponding to STATES
and KEYMAPS.

MAPS consists of paired keys (vectors or strings; also see
`general-implicit-kbd') and definitions (those mentioned in `define-key''s
docstring and general.el's \"extended\" definitions). All pairs (when not
ignored) will be recorded and can be later displayed with
`general-describe-keybindings'.

If DEFINER is specified, a custom key definer will be used to bind MAPS. See
general.el's documentation/README for more information.

Unlike with normal key definitions functions, the keymaps in KEYMAPS should be
quoted (this allows using the keymap name for other purposes, e.g. deferring
keybindings if the keymap symbol is not bound, optionally inferring the
corresponding major mode for a symbol by removing \"-map\" for :which-key,
easily storing the keymap name for use with `general-describe-keybindings',
etc.). Note that general.el provides other key definer macros that do not
require quoting keymaps.

STATES corresponds to the evil state(s) to bind the keys in. Non-evil users
should not set STATES. When STATES is non-nil, `evil-define-key*' will be
used (the evil auxiliary keymaps corresponding STATES and KEYMAPS will be used);
otherwise `define-key' will be used (unless DEFINER is specified). KEYMAPS
defaults to 'global. There is also 'local, which create buffer-local
keybindings for both evil and non-evil keybindings. There are other special,
user-alterable \"shorthand\" symbols for keymaps and states (see
`general-keymap-aliases' and `general-state-aliases').

Note that STATES and KEYMAPS can either be lists or single symbols. If any
keymap does not exist, those keybindings will be deferred until the keymap does
exist, so using `eval-after-load' is not necessary with this function.

PREFIX corresponds to a key to prefix keys in MAPS with and defaults to none. To
bind/unbind a key specified with PREFIX, \"\" can be specified as a key in
MAPS (e.g. ...:prefix \"SPC\" \"\" nil... will unbind space).

The keywords in this paragraph are only useful for evil users. If
NON-NORMAL-PREFIX is specified, this prefix will be used instead of PREFIX for
states in `general-non-normal-states' (e.g. the emacs and insert states). This
argument will only have an effect if one of these states is in STATES or if
corresponding global keymap (e.g. `evil-insert-state-map') is in KEYMAPS.
Alternatively, GLOBAL-PREFIX can be used with PREFIX and/or NON-NORMAL-PREFIX to
bind keys in all states under the specified prefix. Like with NON-NORMAL-PREFIX,
GLOBAL-PREFIX will prevent PREFIX from applying to `general-non-normal-states'.
INFIX can be used to append a string to all of the specified prefixes. This is
potentially useful when you are using GLOBAL-PREFIX and/or NON-NORMAL-PREFIX so
that you can sandwich keys in between all the prefixes and the specified keys in
MAPS. This may be particularly useful if you are using default prefixes in a
wrapper function/macro so that you can add to them without needing to re-specify
all of them. If none of the other prefix keyword arguments are specified, INFIX
will have no effect.

If PREFIX-COMMAND or PREFIX-MAP is specified, a prefix command and/or keymap
will be created. PREFIX-NAME can be additionally specified to set the keymap
menu name/prompt. If PREFIX-COMMAND is specified, `define-prefix-command' will
be used. Otherwise, only a prefix keymap will be created. Previously created
prefix commands/keymaps will never be redefined/cleared. All prefixes (including
the INFIX key, if specified) will then be bound to PREFIX-COMMAND or PREFIX-MAP.

PREDICATE corresponds to a predicate to check to determine whether a definition
should be active (e.g. \":predicate '(eobp)\"). Definitions created with a
predicate will only be active when the predicate is true. When the predicate is
false, key lookup will continue to search for a match in lower-precedence
keymaps.

In addition to the normal definitions supported by `define-key', general.el also
provides \"extended\" definitions, which are plists containing the normal
definition as well as other keywords. For example, PREDICATE can be specified
globally or locally in an extended definition. New global (~general-define-key~)
and local (extended definition) keywords can be added by the user. See
`general-extended-def-keywords' and general.el's documentation/README for more
information.

PACKAGE is the global version of the extended definition keyword that specifies
the package a keymap is defined in (used for \"autoloading\" keymaps)

PROPERTIES, REPEAT, and JUMP are the global versions of the extended definition
keywords used for adding evil command properties to commands.

MAJOR-MODES, WK-MATCH-KEYS, WK-MATCH-BINDINGS, and WK-FULL-KEYS are the
corresponding global versions of which-key extended definition keywords. They
will only have an effect for extended definitions that specify :which-key or
:wk. See the section on extended definitions in the general.el
documentation/README for more information.

LISPY-PLIST and WORF-PLIST are the global versions of extended definition
keywords that are used for each corresponding custom DEFINER.

Act as KEY's definition in the current context.
This uses an extended menu item's capability of dynamically computing a

should be a string given in `kbd' notation and should correspond to a single
definition (as opposed to a sequence of commands). When STATE is specified, look
up KEY with STATE as the current evil state. When specified, DOCSTRING will be
the menu item's name/description. ACCEPT-DEFAULT, NO-REMAP, and POSITION are

(autoload 'general-simulate-key "general" "\
Create and return a command that simulates KEYS in STATE and KEYMAP.
KEYS should be a string given in `kbd' notation. It can also be a list of a
single command followed by a string of the key(s) to simulate after calling that
command. STATE should only be specified by evil users and should be a quoted
evil state. KEYMAP should not be quoted. Both STATE and KEYMAP aliases are
supported (but they have to be set when the macro is expanded). When neither
STATE or KEYMAP are specified, the key(s) will be simulated in the current
context.

If NAME is specified, it will replace the automatically generated function name.
NAME should not be quoted. If DOCSTRING is specified, it will replace the
automatically generated docstring.

Normally the generated function will look up KEY in the correct context to try
to match a command. To prevent this lookup, LOOKUP can be specified as nil.
Generally, you will want to keep LOOKUP non-nil because this will allow checking
the evil repeat property of matched commands to determine whether or not they
should be recorded. See the docstring for `general--simulate-keys' for more
information about LOOKUP.

When a WHICH-KEY description is specified, it will replace the command name in
the which-key popup.

When a command name is specified and that command has been remapped (i.e. [remap
command] is currently bound), the remapped version will be used instead of the
original command unless REMAP is specified as nil (it is true by default).

The advantages of this over a keyboard macro are as follows:
- Prefix arguments are supported
- The user can control the context in which the keys are simulated
- The user can simulate both a named command and keys
- The user can simulate an incomplete key sequence (e.g. for a keymap)

(autoload 'general-key-dispatch "general" "\
Create and return a command that runs FALLBACK-COMMAND or a command in MAPS.
MAPS consists of <key> <command> pairs. If a key in MAPS is matched, the
corresponding command will be run. Otherwise FALLBACK-COMMAND will be run with
the unmatched keys. So, for example, if \"ab\" was pressed, and \"ab\" is not
one of the key sequences from MAPS, the FALLBACK-COMMAND will be run followed by
the simulated keypresses of \"ab\". Prefix arguments will still work regardless
of which command is run. This is useful for binding under non-prefix keys. For
example, this can be used to redefine a sequence like \"cw\" or \"cow\" in evil
but still have \"c\" work as `evil-change'. If TIMEOUT is specified,
FALLBACK-COMMAND will also be run in the case that the user does not press the
next key within the TIMEOUT (e.g. 0.5).

NAME and DOCSTRING are optional keyword arguments. They can be used to replace
the automatically generated name and docstring for the created function. By
default, `cl-gensym' is used to prevent name clashes (e.g. allows the user to
create multiple different commands using `self-insert-command' as the
FALLBACK-COMMAND without explicitly specifying NAME to manually prevent
clashes).

When INHERIT-KEYMAP is specified, all the keybindings from that keymap will be
inherited in MAPS.

When a WHICH-KEY description is specified, it will replace the command name in
the which-key popup.

When command to be executed has been remapped (i.e. [remap command] is currently
bound), the remapped version will be used instead of the original command unless
REMAP is specified as nil (it is true by default).

Translate keys in the keymap(s) corresponding to STATES and KEYMAPS.
STATES should be the name of an evil state, a list of states, or nil. KEYMAPS
should be a symbol corresponding to the keymap to make the translations in or a
list of keymap names. Keymap and state aliases are supported (as well as 'local
and 'global for KEYMAPS). MAPS corresponds to a list of translations (key
replacement pairs). For example, specifying \"a\" \"b\" will bind \"a\" to
\"b\"'s definition in the keymap. If DESTRUCTIVE is non-nil, the keymap will be
destructively altered without creating a backup. If DESTRUCTIVE is nil, a backup
of the keymap will be stored on the initial invocation, and future invocations
will always look up keys in the backup keymap. On the other hand, if DESTRUCTIVE
is non-nil, calling this function multiple times with \"a\" \"b\" \"b\" \"a\",
for example, would continue to swap and unswap the definitions of these keys.
This means that when DESTRUCTIVE is non-nil, all related swaps/cycles should be
